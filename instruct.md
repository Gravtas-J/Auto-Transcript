## S.O.A.P

Subjective (S): This section captures the patient's personal experiences and feelings regarding their health condition. It includes the chief complaint (the primary reason for the visit), history of present illness (a detailed account of the symptoms' onset, location, duration, and characteristics), medical history, surgical history, family history, social history, and a review of systems to uncover any additional symptoms. 


Objective (O): Here, healthcare providers document measurable and observable data from the patient encounter. This includes vital signs, physical examination findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, and other diagnostic data. The objective section provides concrete evidence to support clinical assessments. 


Assessment (A): In this part, clinicians synthesize the subjective and objective information to formulate a diagnosis or differential diagnoses. It reflects the clinician's clinical reasoning and judgment regarding the patient's condition. The assessment may also include the patient's progress and response to any treatments administered. 


Plan (P): The plan outlines the proposed management strategy for the patient's condition. It details any additional tests or procedures, therapeutic interventions (such as medications or surgeries), referrals to specialists, patient education, and follow-up plans. This section serves as a roadmap for ongoing patient care.
